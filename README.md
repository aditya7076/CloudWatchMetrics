# CloudWatchMetrics
Description:
This script, awsmetric2csv.py, helps to collect CPUUtilization and MemoryUtilization metrics.
CPU utilization can be obtained by default from ClouWatch console, but to retrieve MemoryUtilization, CloudWatch Agent has to be installed on the each instance from where the metrics are required.

Installation:

On the VirtualMachine to get metrics of:

1. Install ClouWatch Agent 

   Can be found <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-first-instance.html"> here</a>


For ClouWatch Monitoring Scripts for Amazon EC2 Linux-based instances follow the instructions below. The Perl scripts comprise a fully functional example that reports memroy, swap, and disk space utilization metrics for a linux instance.
All the instructions (Step 1 through 8) can also be found at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/mon-scripts.html"> here </a>


2. Install prerequisite: 
   For some versions of Linux, you must install additional modules before the monitoring scripts will work.
   Log onto to the instance and install the following packages: 
  

  
  Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux AMI
      sudo yum install -y perl-Switch perl-DateTime perl-Sys-Syslog perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-Digest-SHA.x86_64

  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
      sudo zypper install perl-Switch perl-DateTime
      sudo zypper install â€“y "perl(LWP::Protocol::https)"

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9
      sudo yum install perl-DateTime perl-CPAN perl-Net-SSLeay perl-IO-Socket-SSL perl-Digest-SHA gcc -y
      sudo yum install zip unzip
    
	  Run CPAN as an elevated user:
	  sudo cpan
	
	  Press Enter through the Prompts until you see the following prompt:
	  cpan[1]>
	
	  At CPAN prompt, run each of the below commands: run once command and it installs, and when you return to the CPAN prompt, run the next command. Press Enter like beofre when prompted to continue through the process:
	
	  cpan[1]> install YAML 
      cpan[2]> install LWP::Protocol::https 
      cpan[3]> install Sys::Syslog 
      cpan[4]> install Switch 

	
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4
      sudo yum install perl-Switch perl-DateTime perl-Sys-Syslog perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-Digest-SHA --enablerepo="rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional" -y 
      sudo yum install zip unzip
	 

  Ubuntu Server
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install unzip
      sudo apt-get install libwww-perl libdatetime-perl
 	

3. To Download, Install and Configure monitoring scripts
      At the folder where you want to store the monitoring scritps run
	  
      curl https://aws-cloudwatch.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip -O

4. Run the following commands to install the monitoring scripts you downloaded
      unzip CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip && \
      rm CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip && \
      cd aws-scripts-mon

5. Ensure the script has required permission to perform CloudWatch operation.
      If an IAM role has been associated, verify it grants to perform following operations:
  
      cloudwatch:PutMetricData
      cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics
      cloudwatch:ListMetrics
      ec2:DescribeTags
   
6. Specify AWS credentials in a credentials file. Copy awscreds.template file included with monitoring scripts to awscreds.conf as folloes.
     
	  cp awscreds.template awscreds.conf
   
      Add contents to the awscreds.conf file
	 
      AWSAccessKeyId = my-access-key-id
      AWSSecretKey = my-secret-access-key
   
7. To perform a simple test run without posting data to CloudWatch
      ./mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-util --verify --verbose
	 
	 
	 
    A Custom Namespace of "Linux System" will be created on CloudWatch console providing graphical representation of MemoryUtilization.
   
   
8. Start a cron schedule for metrics reported to CloudWatch
       crontab -e 
       */5 * * * * /home/ec2-user/aws-scripts-mon/mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-used-incl-cache-buff --mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail

   
From your terminal:

This script runs only against the target instances that are on the same region as the machine where script is running is on. 
Now,

9. Clone scripts from github.
   
       https://github.com/ccrshishir1/CloudWatchMetrics.git

       Install requirements before running scripts.
       Pip (If not already installed)
       Boto3 (If not already installed)
       Numpy (If not already installed)
       Install AWS CLI (If not already installed)
       Configure AWS CLI (If not already configured)

Usage:
       python awsmetric2csv.py ec2 
        
       By default, number of days the metrics collected of is 7. You can change the number of days to retrieve metric of by using --days option.
      
       --days: specifies number of days to take consideration into
      
       Example: python awsmetric2csv.py ec2 --days 30

    
    
Output: output.csv
